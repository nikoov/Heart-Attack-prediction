# Heart Attack Prediction System

## Overview
The Heart Attack Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of a heart attack in individuals based on their medical attributes. Utilizing a dataset that includes various health indicators, this system trains a model to estimate heart attack risks with significant accuracy. Our aim is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk patients early, enabling preventative measures.

## Features
